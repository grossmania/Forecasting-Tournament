An increase in bias would have occurred if there were a large number of public images and a great expansion of public discourse that linked Asian (or Asian Americans) to a much more negative evaluation. Surely, there had been an ongoing negative evaluation for many years, including at the highest levels of government. Well-publicized events such as murder and mayhem committed by Asians on U.S. soil might have rendered such representation even more negative than they currently are. 
Possibly, events associating Asians and Asian Americans with a positive evaluation, such as it is accorded to popular movie stars or musicians might have reduced the anti-Asian American implicit bias, though it is hard to imagine a star big enough and well-known enough to achieve such a widespread positive evaluation. Moreover, because the IAT taps primarily highly inert associations, it stands to reason that such stars/heros would need to present in the public mind for an extended period of time.
By the same token, this bias could have been reduced, if there had been a dramatic, pervasive and likely emotionally charged even that associated being white, with a negative association (e.g., discovery of blatant and pervasive white racism in government, which at least somewhat undermined the favorability of whites even in the minds of white Americans).",NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA
