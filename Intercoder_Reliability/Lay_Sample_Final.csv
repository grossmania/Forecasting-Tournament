It is no surprise many people especially young people who have seen the country get worse and worse the last two decades - in a macro sense - act out and be pissed off for a host of issues such as inaction on climate change and the continual prioritization of the most well off in our society. Something's gotta give at some and point and we may have reached that point. The Russian Asset has been pouring gasoline on this fire and is facing prosecution if voted out so there is no telling what sort of Reichstag Fire he and Putin are cooking up as of this date 3 June 2020 - we just saw the stunt they pulled gassing protesters in Lafayette Park for a photo op with a bible in front of a church. #BunkerBoi is a fascist and it is well past time for people to recognize it and do something about keeping the country out of the hands of an autocratic dictator who has committed numerous crimes in his lifetime as a conman and, now, as president, such as, at a minimum, the ten obstruction of justice charges laid out in the Mueller Report.

The theoretical assumptions I'm referring to are not irrational. I think that the presidential election will cause a lot more negative tweets, regardless of who wins. I'm hoping that Biden will win; given that, I did not keep the negative tweets on the same spike. I also think that people may be somewhat more positive in the months ahead as their jobs open back up and they're able to work again, which may make them happier, thus the somewhat higher uptick in positive tweets. ","Oh, I guess I should have reserved some thoughts for this box, sorry. Yes, I definitely considered a change in political leadership, which will cause both negative and positive tweets. Given the candidates though, I think that we'll see a lot more negative tweets, especially during the weeks leading up to the election and for a few weeks afterwards. COVID is an interesting variable. While I think that going back to work and life getting back to normal will make some people happy, I also think that we could see  more deaths and that will cause more negativity.",1,"the pandemic isn't going away anytime soon. We'll see more deaths, people will post negative tweets. But we'll also see people happy that they can do things now, so we'll see some uptick in positive tweets. Hopefully in a year, we'll have a more solid way of dealing with COVID, so we may see an uptick in positive and a downward or a slowing down of negative tweets, although I'm sure that plenty of people will still be happy to complain about the president.",1,0,0,1,0,"Mixed",0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA

I expect it to continue to widen due to the continued handling of COVID-19, and now the political unrest that is sweeping the country. There has already been leaked reports of him telling governors that they are ""weak"" for ""allowing"" the violence, which will only shove a deeper wedge between people who support his stance or not. Many of the cities subject to this violence are Democrat-run, which will draw deeper disapproval from them. It may level off during the summer as the country reopens from the pandemic and the unrest settles, but I expect it to spike again around the time of the presidential campaigns. This is when he'll be much more visible, people will be hearing and reacting to his debates, TV ads, and campaign rallies, so his supporters will be more mobilized in support, while Democrats will attack him harder. I based my predictions on Trump losing the 2020 campaign, which makes December and January hard to predict. If he does lose, I can see him enacting a manner of laws as he sees fit, ones which will prove unpopular with people who would prefer him to leave quietly and ride out his term. I expect some bitter reactions to Biden if he wins, Republicans lashing out against losing, and then settling into a new leader with the opinions edging slightly closer together during this ""honeymoon"" period. ","There were a few single-event variables that I expect to make a huge difference. The first is the unrest that has spiked in June- his response has been polarizing, from calling governors weak, attacking blue states, and threatening to send in the military. People who are in these states already disapproved of his leadership, but now it is a much sharper division. I expect the campaign season to be very angry and filled with political attacks against both candidates and their support bases, which will push the difference in opinion to its peak. After that, the change in leadership will probably keep the difference high before it settles as people adjust to a new leader. ",1,"Trump's response has been hit or miss with people from the beginning, with his base believing he took all appropriate action, others believing he ignored warning signs. He bickered with governors early on, largely with blue state leaders, and their opinion of him has not recovered. I don't expect it to as this goes on- if the infection rate spikes again, I expect Democrats to point the finger as his lack of national response of preparedness. They accused him of denying the states PPE and leaving them to fend for themselves, and will do so again if there is a second wave. The same goes for reopening the economy, his supporters will approve of how he handles the reopening and it proves good for business, while Democrats will criticize his economic policies and how he handles getting the economy back on track. I think both the medical and economic aspects of COVID will push opinion farther apart. ",1,0,0,0,0,"Intuition/Theory",0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA

I based this on my perception and people's perception of how the current President is doing and referencing the past data that is also available on the Excel file. 

My theoretical assumption is that, for the time being (May - November), approval rating will be ""mid to low"" approval ratings, given the many uncertainties that are currently going on in the country (COVID-19, George Floyd Murder and the subsequent protest nationwide, economic downfall, etc.) 
However, after the election (November '20 - 2021), whoever the elected President, hopefully, will have brought the spirit of ""a United America"" to the people since in election times, regardless of how polarized it might be, the people are united in electing the right person to be the Commander-in-Chief. I believe it will be somewhat safe to also assume that around that time after election (November '20 - 2021), COVID-19 and the nationwide protest of George Floyd's Murder would have cooled down, which allows the nation to stabilize itself to open its door for the economy to ""work"" again. With the new sense of hope, I assume that approval ratings should have been increasing.

Make note that the approval ratings might not be as high as I predicted, but I believe that, at the very least, it should be much higher than what they are right now.","Indeed I added additional variables to my predictions, particularly the following: COVID-19, George Floyd's Murder and the subsequent nationwide protests regarding the murder, and the steadily declining economic activity and stability. On top of those variables that change overtime, I also assume that single-shot events might have some role on my predictions, particularly the following: a new Commander-in-Chief, a new year (2021), and the government's policy or way to tackle the variables that change overtime which I mentioned earlier.

Currently, the government is dealing with the various situations nationwide very poorly, as could be seen from the media or simply by seeing events unfold themselves by our own eyes. In time, I positively assume that the government would have enough time to prepare ways to tackle that various events (COVID-19, protests, lack of economic activities), after which a new set of data and assumption must be made. Again, I positively assume that those solutions from the government does work; therefore, I predict that both parties - Democrats or Republicans - would have an overall higher approval ratings of the President.

I kept using the words ""the government"" and ""the President"" interchangeably because I do believe that what one polls say about one also says the same thing about the other. In other words, for example, when I currently talk about ""the government"", I am also referring to how President Trump is tackling things; likewise, when I talk about ""the President"", I am also referring to how his overall administration, which he leads, is tackling things.",1,"COVID-19, as it is right now, is very unpredictable.

That said, there will be a lot of uncertainty about it, which explains unrest nationwide; thus, with the current available data, I predict COVID-19 will still have a significant role in decreasing my Political Polarization prediction (decreasing the President's approval rating) until a new discovery or solution of COVID-19 that is able to be applied nationwide is found.",1,0,0,1,0,"Mixed",0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA

I don't know that giving thought to empirical factors based on previous numbers given qualifies as ""scholarly theory"" either.","Looking at those numbers, I don't believe that the absolute difference will vary much any time within the next few years. The way that our population has been whipped into a frenzy, I don't even see us coming together for at least a generation. What the upshot to that will be is anyone's guess. Looking over the next year, it seems fairly clear that the absolute difference will continue with little change.","My theoretical assumptions were, and this doesn't really count May, since it's now June: that with the reopening of the country, there will be a second wave of COVID, as has been predicted; that the President will be just as erratic but self-praising in that as during the initial arrival of the pandemic; that some folks who approved of him will realize ""this really isn't a problem, but if it is, I'm handling it brilliantly"" doesn't really fly as they may see people they know personally who are affected; that the President's behavior will be even more deplorable and bullying as the election approaches, regardless of how it looks like he's faring; that he will commit absolutely egregious acts--if he is not elected, everything he knows he can get away with Nov-Jan, or if he is reelected, an even greater onslaught of horrors knowing that he has nothing to lose since he doesn't have to please anybody for election in 2024; that if he does lose, the right will despise the new president, and the left will worship him as the successor to someone who has been cruel and dictatorial for 4 years. Every new president gets a honeymoon period with their supporters. Can you imagine that period for a Democratic successor to Trump? All of this is, of course, based on the theoretical assumption that we will have an actual functioning election. I'm allowing myself some optimism about that since if I didn't, I would probably have to kill myself.",1,"I don't know what you're referring to in a Life Satisfaction forecast. I haven't addressed that in this study.

It impacts my polarization predictions only slightly, in that I think a second wave may initially lose him a small amount of support in his base. Supporters, for example, think that it's not real or that the (fake news) media has hyped it and criticized him unjustly, may actually see an affect in their own lives as the virus spreads more to rural America rather than mostly in the cities.

The IAT data generated through project implicit represent self-selected participants, who may be more likely to seek out the IAT if they are actively interested in and considering issues of racial bias. Individuals who fit this profile may be more likely to harbor less implicit bias (I am not aware of data on this, although they probably exist).
2. It seems reasonable to predict that the slight downward trend will continue 
3. Assuming the IAT does actually measure implicit bias (debatable), the ability of individuals to control their responses, despite explicitly seeking opportunities to educate themselves regarding issues of race (say, in light of recent events), should be minimal unless (maybe) they exert steady efforts to combat their implicit prejudices over time. 
4. In response to events like the recent series of protests across the U.S. and the world, individuals who wish to change may seek to reduce their implicit biases through active exposure and self-education. However, those that harbor more extensive implicit (or explicit) biases may be more likely to entrench and perhaps amplify their own biases. If both of these speculations are true, equally likely in the population, AND project implicit collects a representative sample of data from U.S. citizens, then you would likely expect any changes in the bias of either group to wash out in the average.","I'm not sure how to explicitly separate my responses to these two questions. The answers above could probably fit here as well. Clearly, the protests and events surrounding the death of George Floyd figure into my assumption that we may see more individuals attempt to self-educate, at least for a little while, and this  may in turn give rise to changes in IAT data.

Some percentage of police interactions with suspected criminals will end violently. In any society, most of the violent criminals can be found among the lowest end of the socio-economic ladder. The people in that socio-economic position will always be more likely to get arrested, and when more of them are getting arrested, more of them will use violence against the police. For reasons completely beyond the control of any police officer, police will kill people who are at the bottom of the socio-economic food chain more often than they kill anyone else, no matter who they are, because all of the disincentives for committing crime in society apply more heavily to people who are economically stable. Due to our nations history, black people are extremely over-represented on that lower end of the socio-economic ladder. As long as that continues to be the case, a disproportionate number of black people will continue to be shot by the police. Thats not racism. Thats not bias - at least not on the part of the police. Its the result of an extremely racist, biased, and unjust history which all of our society is still trying to overcome. Fixing that isnt something a police officer has the expertise to do.

For example, past years data seemed to show a spike in January, May, and September in multiple years. I didn't go looking for data for why that was but did incorporate that into my predictions. Additionally, the general trend when from positive numbers to negative, so I would need something significant to justify any prediction that was outside of a negative number.
","Other data I considered were general events that happened in the country. For example, January 2017 was the inauguration of Donald Trump, and January of 2020 was his impeachment trial. Given that there were spikes at both, and January of 2017 was one of the highest data points, I thought January 2021 would reflect feelings about whatever happens in November of 2020. Additionally, given the current events pushing Black lives matter to the forefront, and people striving for (at least performative) solidarity, I see the explicit racism that flourished under the Trump presidency declining over the next few months, especially June 2020. There may be spikes in fall 2020 due to the election but I think whatever the outcome, the rate will not spike above 1/into the positive. As far as other things, like Covid-19 or unemployment, people seem currently aware of where blame for that lies, so those and other events felt like minor things that might shift the number at the thousandths or farther decimal place, but I am not equipped to estimate to that precision.

However, I think that because of the widespread attention that these events have drawn to issues of racial bias, particularly in regards to police brutality, we might also see a slow, but longer-term downward trend in bias as more people become aware of the pervasive problem of racial bias in society and the experience of African Americans. Because of the scale of current awareness, I think this trend may continue throughout the year. However, I also considered the potential resurgence of negative attention, and thus bias, as the relevant cases, charges, indictments or non-indictments proceed, which could take six months or so. I thought that it may also be relevant that COVID-19 is drawing attention to the systemic inequalities related to health in non-white communities and that this may contribute to the longer-term downward trend of bias, but I was unsure of the specific timeframe of this or how acute this effect might be.","The primary additional variables that I considered, besides prior data were: 1) recent police killings of African Americans, 2) future legal proceedings related to police killings, 3) popular protests and media coverage, and 4) the effect of COVID-19 on the discussions of racial inequality in America.",1,"Intuitively and optimistically, the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to bring to light the long-time, entrenched inequalities in health outcomes between white and non-white communities.

The general trend of the data was flat with peaks and valleys about every 3 months. Because of this as well as the nature of the type of bias being recorded, I tried to maintain this pattern in my predictions. ","This time I actually did not consider many outside predictions. Despite the last question asking about COVID-19 deaths, I still did not see how this would relate to implicit gender-career bias. It is possible that implicit vs. explicit was the variable I considered here. ",2,NA,0,1,0,0,0,"Intuition/Theory",0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA

Since more women are staying at home now and spending time with family, I think the bias will be realized in many households. As women return to work coupled with what I'm predicting to be a rise in women's rights as the election nears, I think the bias will go down as more and more people will become aware that women are just as capable as men with regards to careers and men can be family people too. I think the people who will take that message will plateau at a point and the bias will reach a low-point there until December, the month after what I'm predicting to be Trump victory, and people start to return to their more commonly held biases and ultimately remain flat as I don't expect any other major events to occur that will affect the biases people have.",2,NA,1,0,0,0,0,"Intuition/Theory",0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA
