His crimes, sexism, etc haven't really problems for Republicans in the past, and the aesthetic issues they have with that I don't foresee mattering much at the actual ballot box. However, Biden has a lot of trouble getting support from younger votes and more disillusioned voters who elan democrat, and has a long history of policy and votes on bills that undercut his ability to seem genuine on issues like racism, sexism, poverty, etc. So while the dislike of Trump will help boost the party in general, the actual candidate will hinder that growth.The recent police brutality protests are an example of my thinking here: republicans largely think the protesters are scum, and will most likely support the president cracking down on them.

However, Biden has a lot of trouble getting support from younger votes and more disillusioned voters who elan democrat, and has a long history of policy and votes on bills that undercut his ability to seem genuine on issues like racism, sexism, poverty, etc. So while the dislike of Trump will help boost the party in general, the actual candidate will hinder that growth.The recent police brutality protests are an example of my thinking here: republicans largely think the protesters are scum, and will most likely support the president cracking down on them.

I based this on my perception and people's perception of how the current President is doing and referencing the past data that is also available on the Excel file. 

My theoretical assumption is that, for the time being (May - November), approval rating will be ""mid to low"" approval ratings, given the many uncertainties that are currently going on in the country (COVID-19, George Floyd Murder and the subsequent protest nationwide, economic downfall, etc.) 
However, after the election (November '20 - 2021), whoever the elected President, hopefully, will have brought the spirit of ""a United America"" to the people since in election times, regardless of how polarized it might be, the people are united in electing the right person to be the Commander-in-Chief. I believe it will be somewhat safe to also assume that around that time after election (November '20 - 2021), COVID-19 and the nationwide protest of George Floyd's Murder would have cooled down, which allows the nation to stabilize itself to open its door for the economy to ""work"" again. With the new sense of hope, I assume that approval ratings should have been increasing.

Make note that the approval ratings might not be as high as I predicted, but I believe that, at the very least, it should be much higher than what they are right now.","Indeed I added additional variables to my predictions, particularly the following: COVID-19, George Floyd's Murder and the subsequent nationwide protests regarding the murder, and the steadily declining economic activity and stability. On top of those variables that change overtime, I also assume that single-shot events might have some role on my predictions, particularly the following: a new Commander-in-Chief, a new year (2021), and the government's policy or way to tackle the variables that change overtime which I mentioned earlier.

Currently, the government is dealing with the various situations nationwide very poorly, as could be seen from the media or simply by seeing events unfold themselves by our own eyes. In time, I positively assume that the government would have enough time to prepare ways to tackle that various events (COVID-19, protests, lack of economic activities), after which a new set of data and assumption must be made. Again, I positively assume that those solutions from the government does work; therefore, I predict that both parties - Democrats or Republicans - would have an overall higher approval ratings of the President.

I kept using the words ""the government"" and ""the President"" interchangeably because I do believe that what one polls say about one also says the same thing about the other. In other words, for example, when I currently talk about ""the government"", I am also referring to how President Trump is tackling things; likewise, when I talk about ""the President"", I am also referring to how his overall administration, which he leads, is tackling things.",1,1,2,NA,"COVID-19, as it is right now, is very unpredictable. It is something we have yet to fully understand. That said, I believe for the current timeline (May '20 - November '20), we still would not have yet figured out how to properly ""solve"" COVID-19,  be it for us to find a ""new normal"", or to find the cure or prevention to the virus itself. That said, there will be a lot of uncertainty about it, which explains unrest nationwide; thus, with the current available data, I predict COVID-19 will still have a significant role in decreasing my Political Polarization prediction (decreasing the President's approval rating) until a new discovery or solution of COVID-19 that is able to be applied nationwide is found.",1900000,2000000,2068000,2110000,2150000,2190000,2260000,2330000,2410000,2450000,2470000,2495000,NA,"F_28YXja2yM32bUua","political-polarization-forecast.xlsx",39036,"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,1,0,"Mixed",NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1098,"R_2ZE6zEYBAEMXNLP",0,0,39.17,0,109.943,223.964,234.189,2,20,3.639,6.957,13.716,4,1,2,NA,3,"Full Time Student",2,7,NA,4,"United States of America",1,4,"The predictions were hard, but it got me thinking.

So meaning, they can do a lot more, and what a lot of Caucasians like to do is further themselves with emotional nonpositive feelings and create resource lacks for others. I believe it's all for a lot of Caucasians, and Asians too, that they don't feel they're a part of each others group. I don't know many Chinese anymore, so I cannot say or have been ever able to say. And I guess that's my point, is that they keep to themselves with wealth and attainment. They don't go around and express like certain other people do. The differences will pile up, pulling the data set almost completely away from the previous in magnitude. Just because we are in a state of separation, all of us.

The differences.","I have heard about attacks on Asians, even medical ones, and I am just appalled. Bad apples are spoiling the bunch and misleading others to be hateful, I guess.

The limiting factor is resources, the driving agent is emotion, and an election year is coming up. So large bits of tides are just going to be smacking the heck out of each other.

The IAT data generated through project implicit represent self-selected participants, who may be more likely to seek out the IAT if they are actively interested in and considering issues of racial bias. Individuals who fit this profile may be more likely to harbor less implicit bias (I am not aware of data on this, although they probably exist).
2. It seems reasonable to predict that the slight downward trend will continue 
3. Assuming the IAT does actually measure implicit bias (debatable), the ability of individuals to control their responses, despite explicitly seeking opportunities to educate themselves regarding issues of race (say, in light of recent events), should be minimal unless (maybe) they exert steady efforts to combat their implicit prejudices over time. 
4. In response to events like the recent series of protests across the U.S. and the world, individuals who wish to change may seek to reduce their implicit biases through active exposure and self-education. However, those that harbor more extensive implicit (or explicit) biases may be more likely to entrench and perhaps amplify their own biases. If both of these speculations are true, equally likely in the population, AND project implicit collects a representative sample of data from U.S. citizens, then you would likely expect any changes in the bias of either group to wash out in the average.","I'm not sure how to explicitly separate my responses to these two questions. The answers above could probably fit here as well. Clearly, the protests and events surrounding the death of George Floyd figure into my assumption that we may see more individuals attempt to self-educate, at least for a little while, and this  may in turn give rise to changes in IAT data.

For example, past years data seemed to show a spike in January, May, and September in multiple years. I didn't go looking for data for why that was but did incorporate that into my predictions. Additionally, the general trend when from positive numbers to negative, so I would need something significant to justify any prediction that was outside of a negative number.
","Other data I considered were general events that happened in the country. For example, January 2017 was the inauguration of Donald Trump, and January of 2020 was his impeachment trial. Given that there were spikes at both, and January of 2017 was one of the highest data points, I thought January 2021 would reflect feelings about whatever happens in November of 2020. Additionally, given the current events pushing Black lives matter to the forefront, and people striving for (at least performative) solidarity, I see the explicit racism that flourished under the Trump presidency declining over the next few months, especially June 2020. There may be spikes in fall 2020 due to the election but I think whatever the outcome, the rate will not spike above 1/into the positive. As far as other things, like Covid-19 or unemployment, people seem currently aware of where blame for that lies, so those and other events felt like minor things that might shift the number at the thousandths or farther decimal place, but I am not equipped to estimate to that precision.

Then, I thought about the general trends that we are observing in the world right now and how I thought, purely intuitively, they might play out in the next twelve months. In particular, I thought that we might see a rise in explicit bias in the coming weeks, particularly June, due to the negative, aggressive rhetoric of President Trump and the media coverage of the George Floyd protests. However, I think that because of the widespread attention that these events have drawn to issues of racial bias, particularly in regards to police brutality, we might also see a slow, but longer-term downward trend in bias as more people become aware of the pervasive problem of racial bias in society and the experience of African Americans. Because of the scale of current awareness, I think this trend may continue throughout the year. However, I also considered the potential resurgence of negative attention, and thus bias, as the relevant cases, charges, indictments or non-indictments proceed, which could take six months or so. I thought that it may also be relevant that COVID-19 is drawing attention to the systemic inequalities related to health in non-white communities and that this may contribute to the longer-term downward trend of bias, but I was unsure of the specific timeframe of this or how acute this effect might be.","The primary additional variables that I considered, besides prior data were: 1) recent police killings of African Americans, 2) future legal proceedings related to police killings, 3) popular protests and media coverage, and 4) the effect of COVID-19 on the discussions of racial inequality in America.",1,1,2,NA,"Intuitively and optimistically, the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to bring to light the long-time, entrenched inequalities in health outcomes between white and non-white communities.

For times when people were overly materialistic, namely during Christmas and whatnot, I increased the value, since I thought the whole christmas thing is a tradition and old fashion, and so is much of the reasoning behind gender biases so I linked a correlation there. I also made that connection because many people think that men should be bringing in the bacon for the family, and a time like christmas where money is heavily spent, people may think of the male to be providing for the family's gifts. I didn't make many other assumptions, other than the fact that it will get worse, since I put a higher value at the end of the chart values than the beginning. I did this because I think that Trump's rule over America, and his example as a whole to the world will cause people to return to old biases that they had, which may be the case with gender career bias as well.

I looked and noticed that overall the data has fallen within a somewhat narrow of a range since 2017, so I didn't believe there would be any major changes in the data going forward. I took into account the change in behaviors that males and females may be doing now and why that might be a reason for why the bias has been increasing recently (more people are staying at home and practicing these biases themselves). I also took into account the political landscape that is coming up and factored in who I think will win to how the bias will change. I also factored in the fact that people will not be locked down forever and may start to break away from traditional gender roles.","I have the trend continuing to slightly increase and then stay stagnant as I think the layoffs of women and the fact that work is closed down will have reached a plateau so people will hit the peak of gender-career bias. Since more women are staying at home now and spending time with family, I think the bias will be realized in many households. As women return to work coupled with what I'm predicting to be a rise in women's rights as the election nears, I think the bias will go down as more and more people will become aware that women are just as capable as men with regards to careers and men can be family people too. I think the people who will take that message will plateau at a point and the bias will reach a low-point there until December, the month after what I'm predicting to be Trump victory, and people start to return to their more commonly held biases and ultimately remain flat as I don't expect any other major events to occur that will affect the biases people have.",NA,0,2,NA,NA,900000,1300000,1700000,2000000,2400000,2700000,3100000,3500000,3900000,4400000,4600000,4800000,NA,"F_WBYYzWjqqe9BbO1","gender_implicit_bias_updated.xlsx",39888,"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,"Intuition/Theory",NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2223,"R_1flKX795GQeEgeB",0,0,26.778,0,17.939,98.314,119.695,2,22,2.519,5.488,24.081,3,1,2,NA,5,"Currently Unemployed",4,10,NA,6,"United States",2,5,"I hope I attached the right file for the implicit bias one, as I think I may have put the file that I downloaded and not the file that had the data I put in.

I didn't make many other assumptions, other than the fact that it will get worse, since I put a higher value at the end of the chart values than the beginning.

a) The ratio had been fluctuated between 0.8 and 0.9.
b) The ratio is bouncing like a sin function. It goes up and down over the period of time. 
c) The ratio decreased significantly during COVID-19 pandemic. This event reduced the amount of employment. This pandemic also caused the lock down and children to be at home most of the time. Thus, during this time, there will be 2 responsibilities in the house: work for money and take care of children. The traditional view becomes dominant. Men is expecting getting job while women is expecting to take care of children.
d) Once the lock down is almost over, the ratio appear to get back to normal.
From these assumption, I am guessing that the ratio got back to normal before the second wave of COVID-19 around Fall of 2020.
