Thus, we use the linear trend observed previous three years’ data to predict trajectory over the following 12 months. Spikes and valleys observed in the previous data are probably caused by unforeseen societal events (e.g., conflicts) or random error, and these are essentially impossible to predict. For example, few people would have predicted a global pandemic or widespread unrest over police brutality to the resolution of a month with much confidence at any time in 2019. Nor would they have predicted people’s attitudes changing in reaction to such events. Our stance is that while fluctuations will probably be observed in future data, we can only make predictions about the larger ongoing trend, and that they will not be affected by monthly fluctuations. Therefore, we do not attempt to predict variations around the linear trends.

In addition, relative deprivation—the perception that one’s self or group does not receive valued resources, goals, or standards of living (Kunst & Obaidi, 2020)—might play a role in ideological preferences. Assuming that Americans value their economic resources, and that they perceive themselves to be victims of their country’s challenging economic circumstances, this relative deprivation during COVID-19 may trigger supporting the Republican party to counter Americans’ lost economic resources.
